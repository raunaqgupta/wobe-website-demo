Wobe was developed by a team of technological, community and financial specialists brought together by a love for Indonesia. We are a fintech startup based in Jakarta, Indonesia, where we have been building solutions for the communities around us.

In 2015, we graduated Ideabox accelerator as top of class out of 7 startups.

In 2016, we raised our seed funding round with some of the best investors in the world to take our vision to more Indonesians.

We believe in local solutions for global issues, and here you'll find our razor focus on Indonesia helps us do this one thing well: be effective and successful in Indonesia

## How Wobe Works

Wobe provides employment to women in Indonesia by giving them easy access to the selling of prepaid phone airtimes, known locally as pulsa, on their Android devices.

It consumes very low data usage and works on phones in that category.

We partner with community and commercial partners like co-ops, micro-finance and non-profits as well as roll out own launch events in order to reach places and women outside of Jakarta.
