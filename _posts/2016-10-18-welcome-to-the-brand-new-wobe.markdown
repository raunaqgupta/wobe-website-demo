We're very proud to announce the launch of a brand new Wobe — we are brand new in every way.

Our new website outlines our commitment to what we do: increasing access to financial inclusion. We do this by making it easy for anyone with a low end Android device to start a small business in selling phone airtime and other digital products. The communities they live in benefit from having agents who link them to digital services at market rates, without having to travel for those reloads.

Our new app is now available to anyone in Indonesia with an Android device. To get started, agents simply have to download Wobe from the Play Store, put in some stored value (*saldo*), then start selling phone airtime from any operator to their friends and family.

Over the coming weeks we will be sharing news about the Wobe community in different locations around Indonesia. We invite you to join the Wobe family — download our app, talk to us, or tell us what you think!
