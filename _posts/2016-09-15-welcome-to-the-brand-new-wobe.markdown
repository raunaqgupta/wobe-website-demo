We're very proud to announce the launch of a brand new Wobe â€” we are brand new in every way.

New app, new website. New everything.

Today, we renew our dedication to our mission. We want to make the world a better place, especially for the women in it.

Enterprise and commerce have been a big part of women's lives, especially in Java, for thousands of years. A book that details the lives of women in Java in the 8th century tells us, "What strikes us directly when arriving in Batavia? That everywhere a large crowd of women is moving around..., everywhere are women and still more women... and in the warungs again women, restlessly active, preparing things to eat or drink or serving clients... women are busy hulling the paddy."

It is the same today. All over Indonesia, women are providing for their families and caring for them. We honour that by creating our innovative financial inclusion solutions that focus on women in this country.

With Wobe, our aim is to provide meaningful employment to every woman who needs one. Starting with the brand new Wobe app, available today, we will do just that.

Now, anyone anywhere in Indonesia can download our app from the Play Store. They'll put in some stored value, or saldo, through a bank transfer or a Wobe employee. Those who have accessed Wobe through a Wobe event will get to do that on the spot, without having to make that journey themselves.

Once you have stored value (saldo) in your account, you can start selling pulsa rightaway. All operators are available.

We invite you to join the Wobe family, and to grow with us as we embark on this journey.

Who will be the first 100 to download our new app? Download here and comment on our [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/wobe.io), and you may be able to win some free saldo!
